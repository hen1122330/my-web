   Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

   Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

        PSG chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi added his own thoughts in glowing terms: "I would like to thank Leo Messi for his two seasons in Paris. To see a seven-time Ballon d’Or winner in the Rouge & Bleu and at Parc des Princes, winning back-to-back Ligue 1 titles and inspiring our younger players has been a pleasure. His contribution to Paris Saint-Germain and Ligue 1 cannot be understated and we wish Leo and his family all the best for the future."
        In his two years at the club, Messi helped the club to win consecutive Ligue 1 titles as well as the 2022 Trophee des Champions. After a slow start in statistical terms, Messi managed 32 goals and 34 assists in 74 total appearances for the club. He was awarded a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.
        He also led Argentina to World Cup glory in Qatar last December. Last month, Messi passed long-time rival Cristiano Ronaldo to become the all-time leading scorer in Europe's top five leagues.
        Messi's exit means that he will miss a chance to revive that rivalry given that PSG's next scheduled match is a friendly against Ronaldo's Al-Nassr at the end of July.According to reporting by The Athletic, Messi was earning in the region of £60M per year in Paris, inclusive of bonuses and other factors.
        It was reported in December that a verbal agreement over a new deal had been reached between the Argentinian icon and the French giants but if those reports were accurate, an official contract never materialised.
        The former Barcelona star clashed with the club over a recent trip to Saudi Arabia, and also had several run-ins with manager Christophe Galtier.
        Despite the signing of Messi, PSG were still unable to achieve their long-stated goal of winning the UEFA Champions League and now face another rebuilding summer. In addition to Messi's departure, there are significant rumours around the future of fellow star Neymar, while Galtier is also widely expected to leave.

        Messi's next stop could be a return to Barcelona with those rumours having begun shortly after his emotional departure from the Catalan capital in 2021. He has also been rumoured as the next high-profile target for the Saudi Pro League and is a long-term target for MLS. A move to boyhood club Newell’s Old Boys is another possibility, with Messi always having reportedly wanted to do so at some point before retirement.

        Inter Miami captain Lionel Messi ended his first season in the United States on Saturday night.

        His debut campaign in Major League Soccer ended with a defeat as Miami lost 1-0 to Charlotte at Bank of America Stadium.
        
        This was Messi's second MLS loss, coming in his sixth game in the competition.
        
        Miami won three of the six MLS fixtures in which Messi featured this season, drawing one.
        
        With Messi, Miami had an MLS win percentage of 50% this season, compared to 21.43% without him.
        
        As well as being directly involved in three MLS goals - scoring one and assisting two - Messi attempted 29 dribbles, won 13 free-kicks, fired in 20 shots and played 205 passes, including six key passes.
